# What I learned from this Project
- API Keys
- How to scrub API keys using enviormental variables
- What enviormental variables are and how to create them
- Libraries (base64, requests, hashlib, os)
- Creating python dictionaries
  -Assigning a key with a value
- Encoding and SHA256 in programming
- response.status.codes

Challenges I faced:
- Importing API keys
- Having my program scan the URL without crashing

How I solved it:
- I began by reviewing others URL scanner projects to get a general idea of how the program should run or certain libraries and tools used, such as requests, haslib, etc.
I looked up articles on each library to understand what they are used for. I also looked at problems others were facing on stack overflow regarding these libraries, and
seen the solutions for them. I used AI to explain bugs and why they occured. If I ever came across a tool which would help complete the program, I asked for a detailed
explanation and would go through each line, function and argument to learn how it fully worked.

I plan to add a file scanner to the program,
I hope to learn:
- Learning to call the file system in a program
- How a program interacts with the storage system and operating system in more depth
  
Thank you!
