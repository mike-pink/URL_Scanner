# What I learned from this Project
- API Keys
- How to scrub API keys using enviormental variables
- What enviormental variables are and how to create them
- Libraries (base64, requests, hashlib, os)
- .strip(), .digest(), .lower().
- Encoding and SHA256 in programming
- response.status.codes

Challenges I faced:
- Importing API keys
- Having my program scan the URL without crashing

How I solved it:
- I began by reviewing others URL scanner projects to get a general idea of how the program should run or certain libraries and tools used, such as requests, haslib, etc.
  I looked up articles on each library to understand what they are used for. I also looked at problems others were facing on stack overflow regarding these libraries, and
  seen the solutions for them. I used AI to help teach me what i was doing wrong when I came across bugs, I also used it to point out bugs for me and I would ask why a bug
  doesn't work and why the solution fixes it.
